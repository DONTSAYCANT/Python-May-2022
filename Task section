Task1:

Data type conversion table

int ===> convert it in to float bool str
float ===> convert it in to int bool str
bool ===> convert it in to float int str
str ===> convert it in to float bool int

Task2:

For below programs collect input from user, pi is constant value 3.14 (print output in formatted way)

write a program to calculate perimeter of the circle with radius 10.2
write a program to calculate area of circle with radius (float) (collect using input function)
write a program to calculate perimeter of the cricle with radius (float) (collect it through input function)
Collect radius and height from user,
calculate Area of cone (area of cone = 0.33 * pi * r * r * h) (int)
